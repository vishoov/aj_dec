API Authentication or user auth is process of verifying the users, whether they are a part of the application or not, and making them staying LOGGED IN

Token based authentication so that 

we are able to segregate usage of these following routes

public routes -> where no authentication is required
protected routes-> where only authenticated users are allowed 


signup, login -> public routes 

Why do we need token based authentication 
1. Stateless API -> we cannot store any info (this is why session based auth is no longed used)
2. RESTful -> each route is independant
