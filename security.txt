Sceurity Threats


1. XSS -> cross site scripting 
2. DB Injection Attacks
3. DDoS Attacks -> Distributed Denial of Service  -> bottle neck of our server 
4. Insecure databases -> information encryption and network access on the database
5. Server Security 
6. Broken Authentication done 
7. Encryption of sensitive database
8. dotenv environment security 

Security Best Practices 

1. Encryption -> encrypt any sensitive information, so that even if the database is compromised, the information is still secure

password ->9fgogf80te08pib;kfbidg08t08g

BCrypt -> npm i bcrypt

signup / login ->  encrypt   -> DB 


2. Rate Limiting 

Prevents DDoS Attack -> limit the number of requests that you allow the server to respond to in a given frame of time

npm i express-rate-limiter


3. Monitoring or logging 

help us create a record of the requests that we have recieved on our server and then we can have a record of these requests


if our server crashes so we can identify which was the last request that we received before the server crashed


4. API Authentication


JWT -> Json Web Token
this is used to secure protected routes in the API
JWT is a compact, json friendly, lightweight, and highly secure token that helps 
in securing the APIs and implementing role based Authentication


xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
xxxx-> header -> this contains technical information about token and its creation
for example algorithm, type, expires in
yyyyy-> payload -> this is the information that is specific to the users, this is used to verify which token is for which users
zzzzz-> signature-> signature is like salt that is added to the string to make it even harder to decode 

Implementation 

this will be implemented thrugh a middleware 

npm i jsonwebtoken

5. XSS cross site scripting 


sanitize the inputs so that any script (malicious sent by hacker) should not be executed on the server


npm i xss
or
input sanitization


6. Database security -> 

    modify the IP Access list 

    model

7. Server Security 

    IP Access -> only allowing those users who are in the IP access list 

    amazon -> backend -> front end 

    CORS-> Cross Origin Resource Sharing -> this specifies to what client our server will be allowed to respond 

    Fullstack

    front end           back end
    (UI)                (Data Mgmnt)
    192.168.0.1         190.129.1.1
            -------------> the request should be from our front end only 


    

8. Environment Security 

    dotenv -> protects and hides our API keys, DB URIs
