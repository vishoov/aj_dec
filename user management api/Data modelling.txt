Data modelling is used for defining structure of the data, including data types, validation rules, default values, and behaviour of documents in a specific mongoDB collection.

Schema is the foundation of implementing business logic in our applications 

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name:String,
  email:String,
  age:Number
})

{
    name:"AJ",
    email:"aj@aj.com",
    age:1000
}

this is a basic user schema that defines the structure of each user's info that will be stored in the database 


Schema Type options 

type: String, 
or Number, Array, Boolean, Relation 

required = boolean value that checks if the field is MANDATORY or not 

unique = takes boolean value to make sure there is no duplicacy of any value present in the field 

trim = removes unecessary spaces from starting and ending of the string 

lowercase = boolean value, when true, it will convert the data to lowercase before saving 

String specific rules 
    minLength:4,
    maxLength:30

immutable:true will FIX the data, meaning it cannot be changed once created


//regex - regular expressions 

//email -> @, .com or .in .org 

Number specific rules 
min:18, 
max:200,
