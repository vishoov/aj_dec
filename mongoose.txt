mongoose 

object data moddeling library in javascript that is designed for mongoDB in node.js

SCHEMA!!!! 
mongoose will bridge the gap between mongoDB's schema-less nature and the need for data structuring or data validation in our applications. 

This is important because we will be able to enforce data structuring in mongoDB documents, which helps us in validating the data making sure that there is no data inconsistency 

it simplifies database operations by providing a model-based approach for CRUD operations 


Everything in mongoose will start with a schema
