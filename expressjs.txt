Express.js is a 

- fast  
- unopinionated 
- minimalist 

web framework that works best with node.js that helps in simplifying server side routing 

1. terminal -> npm i express
2. inside the endpoint file 

import express from 'express'

- to include all the express features 
- create an instance of express application 

const app = express()


Routing ->  define how the backend application will respond to client requests at specific endpoints (URIs - uniform resource identifier) with specific HTTP methods 

- method
- route 
- data 
- headers 



Middlewares -> functions that are executed in our application in MIDDLE of the request response cycle 

WHY EXPRESS.JS? 

the request and response objects are the references to the data that we have recieved from the user (req) and the data that we respond with (res)


req 

.json -> 

req example 

{
    "headers":{ 
        this object contains the specifications of the request 
        type 
        security
        authorization
        ip 
        host name 
        allowed headers
    },
    "body":{
        user specific data 
    }
}


res -> is used for sending HTTP response with various content types 

MVC architecture -> for increasing the scalability 
Model View Controller
